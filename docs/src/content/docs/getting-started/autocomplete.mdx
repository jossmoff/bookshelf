All of this information is taken from the [click documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/), and you should read it if you want to know more.
In order for completion to be used, the user needs to register a special function with their shell.
The script is different for every shell, and Click will output it for bookshelf when called with `_BOOKSHELF_COMPLETE` set to `{shell}_source`.
The built-in shells are bash, zsh, and fish.

## Using Eval

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Bash">
	    Add this to ~/.bashrc:
		```bash
		eval "$(_BOOKSHELF_COMPLETE=bash_source bookshelf)"
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Zsh">
		Add this to ~/.zshrc:
        ```bash
        eval "$(_BOOKSHELF_COMPLETE=zsh_source bookshelf)"
        ```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Fish">
	    Add this to ~/.config/fish/completions/bookshelf.fish:
		```bash
		_BOOKSHELF_COMPLETE=fish_source bookshelf | source
		```
		This is the same file used for the activation script method below. For Fish itâ€™s probably always easier to use that method.
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using an Activation Script
Using eval means that the command is invoked and evaluated every time a shell is started, which can delay shell responsiveness.
To speed it up, write the generated script to a file, then source that.
You can generate the files ahead of time and distribute them with your program to save your users a step.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Bash">
	    Save the script somewhere.
        ```bash
        _BOOKSHELF_COMPLETE=bash_source bookshelf > ~/.bookshelf-complete.bash
        ```
        Source the file in ~/.bashrc.
        ```bash
        . ~/.bookshelf-complete.bash
        ```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Zsh">
		Save the script somewhere.
        ```bash
        _BOOKSHELF_COMPLETE=zsh_source bookshelf > ~/.bookshelf-complete.zsh
        ```
        Source the file in ~/.zshrc.
        ```bash
        . ~/.bookshelf-complete.zsh
        ```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Fish">
	    Save the script to ~/.config/fish/completions/bookshelf.fish:
        ```bash
        _BOOKSHELF_COMPLETE=fish_source bookshelf > ~/.config/fish/completions/bookshelf.fish
        ```
	</TabItem>
