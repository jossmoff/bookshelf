## Why need a glossary?

There are a couple of terms thrown around in the bookshelf documentation that you might not be familiar with.
This glossary should help you understand what they mean.

## Bookshelf
A **bookshelf** is a representation of the whole collection of work that you have planned, are doing or have done.

## Story
A **story** is a representation of a larger piece of work that you have to do.
In the agile development world, this is usually a user story, but could also represent a subtask or an epic.
It is simply a piece of work.

## Chapter
A **chapter** is the representation of the individual chunks of time you have dedicated to a story.
By measuring the chunks of time you are actively developing a story, you can get a better idea of how long it will take to complete.
